create a file after we create a nice structure
generate reset code once the forgot pass is clicked and save it in the database

in resetPassword.php
we need to add some password validation when the user is resetting it

updatePassword check password match with old random salt


Ola

in resetPasswordForm.php
add a forgot password form to the login with email


Check if reset password matches the previous password



prevent folder navigation in the browser


//Login attempts

we have to decide how we are handling the login attempts
-block login after n attempts and require password reset
-block for t time after n attempts and afterwards delete the attempts

now we have a combination of the two.
when we have five attempts we send the reset pass email but we also delete the attempts after some time
